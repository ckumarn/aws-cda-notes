## Lambda
* Lambda functions and event sources are the core components of AWS Lambda
* Event sources (are usually) the AWS services that can be configured to invoke a lambda function
    * this configuration is called the *event source mapping*. It enables the automatic invocation of your lambda
    function when events occur

### Event Source Mappings
* Push based event sources
    * event mappings are maintained within the event source
    * you grant the event source permission to invoke your lambda function using a resource based policy
* Poll based event sources (kinesis, dynamodb, sqs)
    * lambda function *polls* the event source and *pulls* data to the function when an event becomes available
    * event source mapping maintained with the lambda function
    * lambda needs your permission to poll the stream source:
        * You grant the permission via the *execution role*, using the permissions policy associated with a role 
        that you specify when you create your lambda function.
        * AWS Lambda does *not* need any permissions to invoke your lambda function
* Custom Applications
    * you write these applications and invoke the lambda yourself 
        * you use the `Invoke` api (via an AWS SDK or using the aws cli `invoke` command)
    * you don't need to set-up an event source mapping
    * if the application and lambda function are owned by different accounts, the account the owns the lambda function
    must allow cross-account permissions in the permission policy associated with the lambda function

### Limits
* Memory
    * **128MB** min to **3008MB** max (in 64MB increments)
* ephemeral disk space in /tmp **512MB**
* number of processes and threads combined **1024**
* max execution duration **5 minutes**
* Synchronous (RequestResponse) invoke request body payload size: **6MB**
* Asynchronous (Event) invoke request **128MB**
* Deployment package size (compressed .zip/.jar) **50MB**
* Size of code dependencies  (uncompressed zip/jar) **250MB**
* Environment variables size (total) **4KB**
* Total size of **all** deployment packages per region **75GB**


#### Concurrency Limits
* Account Level limits:
    * **1000** by default
    * can be increased by opening a case in AWS Support Center
    * there is also an **immediate concurrency burst limit** that **varies per region**
    * if the burst limit is reached, AWS will increase lambda function executions by **500 per minute**
* Function Level limits 
    * set per function
        * set in the console or via aws cli (`PutFunctionConcurrency`)
        * Use the `GetFunction` cli command to view concurrency limits for a specific function 
    * count towards the account level limits
    * By setting a concurrency limit on a function, Lambda guarantees that allocation will be applied 
    specifically to that function, regardless of the amount of traffic processing remaining functions
    * once concurrency limit is reached for a function, the function is throttled


### Supported Event Sources
This topic lists the supported AWS services that you can configure as event sources for AWS Lambda functions.
For poll-based sources, the lambda function maintains the event source mapping. For all others, the event source
mapping is maintained by the source
* **Amazon DynamoDB** (poll based, stream based)
* **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**  (poll based, stream based)
* **Amazon Simple Queue Service** (poll based)
* Amazon Simple Notification Service
* Amazon S3
* Amazon Simple Email Service
* Amazon Cognito
* AWS CloudFormation
* Amazon CloudWatch Logs
* Amazon CloudWatch Events
* AWS CodeCommit
* Scheduled Events (powered by Amazon CloudWatch Events)
* AWS Config
* Amazon Alexa
* Amazon Lex
* Amazon API Gateway
* AWS IoT Button
* Amazon CloudFront
* Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose


* AWS Lambda provides the `CreateEventSourceMapping` operation for you to create and manage the event source mapping. 
* The invocation type that these event sources use when invoking a Lambda function is also preconfigured. 
For example, Amazon S3 always invokes a Lambda function asynchronously and Amazon Cognito invokes a Lambda 
function synchronously. The only time you can control the invocation type is when you are invoking the 
Lambda function yourself using the `invoke` operation (for example, invoking a Lambda function on demand 
from your custom application).

## Scaling Behaviour
### Estimating Concurrent invocations
* In general
    * `events (or requests) per second * function duration`
    * ex. S3 lambda function takes 3 secs to process an event. S3 publishes 10 events per seconds = 30 concurrent executions
* For Poll based sources that are stream based:
    * the number of shards is the unit of concurrency
        * 100 active shards = at most 100 lambda functions running concurrently. This is because Lambda processes 
        each shardâ€™s events in sequence.
* Poll-based event sources that are not stream-based:
    * SQS Queues:
        * lambda will scale polling on the queue until maximum concurrency level is reached
            * either 1000, the account concurrency limit, or (optional) function limit, whichever is lower
        * each message batch can be considered a single concurrent unit
        * Lambda uses long-polling (to reduce cost)
        * SQS supports an initial burst of 5 concurrent function invocations per minute, and increases it 
        by **60** concurrent invocations per minute

### Request Rate 
rate at which your lambda is invoked
* For all services except stream based, the `request rate = rate at which event source generates the events`
* For stream-based services:
    * `request rate = number of concurrent executions / function duration`
    * ex. 5 active shards on a stream (i.e. 5 active lambda functions running in parallel), and your lambda takes
    2 seconds to run, request rate = 2.5 requests per second
    
### Throttling behavior
* Non-stream based event sources
    * Synchronous invocations:
        * function returns **429** error and the invoking service is responsible for retries
        * the `ThrottleReason` error code explains if there was a function level throttle or account level throttle
        * each service may have its own retry policy
    * Asynchronous invocation:
        * aws will automatically retry the throttled event for up to six hours, with delays between retries
        * you can configure a Dead Letter Queue to investigate why your function was throttled
* Poll based sources, stream-based (such as kinesis, dynamodb)
    * lamda will attempt to process the throttled batch of records until the time the data expires
        * can be up to **7 days** for kinesis streams
    * the throttled request is treated as blocking per shard, Lambda doesn't read any new records from the shard
    until the throttled batch of records either expires or succeeds
    * if there is more than one shard in the stream, lambda continues invoking on the non-throttled shards until
    one gets through
* Poll based event source, not stream-based (such as SQS)
    * lambda will attempt to process the throttled batch of records until it is successfully invoked (in which case
    it is automatically deleted from the queue) or until the `MessageRetentionPeriod` set for the queue expires

### Monitoring concurrency usage
uses cloudwatch metrics
* ConcurrentExecutions - concurrent executions at the account level, and for any function with a custom concurrency limit
* UnreservedConcurrentExecutions - shows total concurrent executions for functions assigned to the default 
"unreserved" concurrency pool 
    

     
### Handlers (in Java)
* two approaches for creating a handler
    * load handler method directly without implementing an interface
    * implement a standard interface provided by `aws-lambda-core-library`
* general syntax for handler is `outputType handler-name(inputType input, Context context) {...}`
    * in order for handler to be invoked, input data must be serializable into the data type of the input parameter
    * inputType - can be event data published by an event source or custom input that a developer provides
    such as String or a custom object(must be serializable)
    * outputType - 
        * if you plan to invoke the lambda synchronously (using `RequestResponse` invocation type) 
        you can return the output of your function using any of the supported data types
        * if you plan to invoke asynchronously (using the `Event` invocation type), the output type should
        be void
            * Example: S3 and SNS use the `Event` invocation type
* inputType and outputType can be:
    * Simple Java types (AWS Lambda supports the String, Integer, Boolean, Map, and List types) 
    * Pre-defined AWS event types defined in `aws-lambda-java-events`
    * POJO (Plain Old Java Object) type
        * AWS will automatically serialize and deserialize input and output JSON based on the POJO type
        * AWS Lambda serializes based on standard bean naming conventions (see The Java EE 6 Tutorial). 
        You should use mutable POJOs with public getters and setters
        * If you use POJOs for input and output, you need to provide implementation of the `RequestClass` and 
        `ResponseClass` types
    * Stream type (If you do not want to use POJOs or if Lambda's serialization approach does not meet your needs,
     you can use the byte stream implementation
* you can omit the `Context` parameter if it isn't needed
